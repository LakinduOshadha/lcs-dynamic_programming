Finds Longest Common Subsequence of given two Strings


The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) - Dynamic Programming

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without 
changing the order of the remaining elements. The Longest common subsequence (LCS) of two sequences 
is a subsequence, with maximal length, which is common to both the sequences.

Given two strings, A = a1a2...an and B = b1b2...bm, find the longest common subsequence and print it. If there 
are multiple common subsequences with the same maximum length, print all of them.

Input Format
Two strings A and B given in two lines.
 
Constraints
The characters of strings are English lowercase alphabetic letters.
0 <= length(A), length(B) <= 100

Output Format
Print the longest common subsequence on one line. In case of multiple valid answers, print all of them one 
subsequence per line.

Sample Input 
president
providence

Sample Output 
priden
